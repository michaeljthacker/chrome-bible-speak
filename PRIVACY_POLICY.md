# Privacy Policy for Bible Name Aid

**Effective Date:** December 9, 2025

## Overview

Bible Name Aid is a Chrome browser extension that enhances webpages by adding phonetic pronunciation guides for Biblical names. This privacy policy explains our data practices.

## Data Collection and Storage

**Bible Name Aid does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

Specifically:

- **No Analytics:** We do not use analytics services, tracking pixels, or any telemetry.
- **No User Data Collection:** We do not collect, store, or process any information about you, your browsing habits, or your activity.
- **No Account Required:** The extension does not require registration, login, or any form of user account.
- **No Third-Party Data Sharing:** We do not share any data with third parties because we don't collect any data.

## How the Extension Works

1. **Local Processing Only:** When you visit a webpage, the extension scans the page content locally in your browser for Biblical names from our pronunciation database.

2. **User Preferences:** Your preferences (such as which names you've enabled pronunciations for, and whether the extension is globally on/off) are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's built-in storage API. This data never leaves your device.

3. **External Links:** When you click on a pronunciation link added by the extension, you will be directed to the corresponding page on BibleSpeak.org. This is a standard webpage visit - we do not send BibleSpeak.org any data beyond what your browser normally sends when visiting any website (such as IP address, user agent, etc.).

## Third-Party Services

The extension uses pronunciation data sourced from [BibleSpeak.org](https://biblespeak.org), a separate website not affiliated with or controlled by Bible Name Aid. When you click pronunciation links, you are visiting BibleSpeak.org directly. Please refer to their privacy policy for information about their data practices.

## Permissions Explanation

The extension requests the following Chrome permissions:

- **`activeTab`:** Allows the extension to read and modify the current webpage you're viewing to add pronunciation guides.
- **`storage`:** Allows the extension to save your preferences (enabled names, on/off state) locally on your device.

These permissions are used solely for the functionality described above.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated effective date.
